PICCANTE
========

The hottest hdr imaging library

PICCANTE is a C++11 image processing library aimed to provide structures and functionalities for enabling both High Dynamic Range (HDR) and standard imaging.

DEPENDENCIES:
==============
Piccante uses STB image library for reading and writing PNG and JPEG files.
STB can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/nothings/stb

By default this library is needed to run all examples, and needs to be localed
as follow:
``` C
-folder
+___"piccante"
+___"stb"
```

If you have STB in the system path you can disable the local path include system
by adding the following define before including piccante.hpp:
``` C
#define PIC_DISABLE_STB
```


To disable the use of STB, you can add the following define before including piccante.hpp:
 ``` C
#define PIC_DISABLE_STB_LOCAL
 ```


HOW TO INSTALL:
===============

1) Unzip the file .zip in a FOLDER on your machine

2) Add piccante include directory in your include path

3) Include "piccante.hpp" in your project

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQs):
==================================


**Question:** Can I disable OpenGL?

**Answer:** Yes, you can do it. You need to add this line of code before
including piccante.hpp in your project:
``` C
#define PIC_DISABLE_OPENGL
#include "piccante.hpp"
```

##
**Question:** Can I use my version of Eigen instead of the one in the bundle?

**Answer:** Yes, you can do it. You just need to add this line of code before
including piccante.hpp in your project:
``` C
#define PIC_EIGEN_NOT_BUNDLED
#include "piccante.hpp"
```

##
**Question:** Can I use OpenEXR instead of TinyEXR?

**Answer:**  Yes, you can do it. You just need to add these two lines of code before
including piccante.hpp in your project:
``` C
#define PIC_DISABLE_TINY_EXR
#define PIC_ENABLE_OPEN_EXR
#include "piccante.hpp"
```

SCREENSHOTS:
============
Piccante can be used for generating HDR images starting from a stack of classic 8-bit
images.

![HDR Generation](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/piccante/img/hdr_generation.png?raw=true "HDR Generation")

Piccante can manage different color spaces, and new ones can be added to its core with ease. 

![Color Spaces](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/piccante/img/color_spaces.png?raw=true "Color Spaces")

Piccante provides algorithms for tone mapping HDR images in order to be visualized on traditional displays.

Piccante can filter images using a high quality selection of linear and non linear filters.
