- The program stays idle, apparently doing nothing, 
  when trying to read a .jpg/.JPG/.JPEG images. Seeing the
  implementation of Read, I noted that if you comment function
  "readEXIF" it works(?).
  An implementation of the error can be found in tests/jpg_test

- For every filter, I binded every public function that there is.
  While doing so I started thinking if it's better to just bind the
  "execute" function, since I think it's the only function a user 
  would use.

- In ImageVec I noticed some typos 

- Some functions of some filter use as a variable ImageVec, is
  it necessary to bind it?

- For testing I'm doing the function in a C++ program, see what it
  does and then doing the same in python and see if it does the same.

- In getMaxVal and getMinVal I noticed that if the passed box is NULL,the
  code defines a new BBow with the width, height and frames of the image.
  But when declared, the Image would create a protected BBox called "fullbox"
  with the same dimension. It's not better to pass that, instead of creating
  a totally new one?

- I added a lambda function to the bindigs of
  scaleCosine, all the flips to check if the image
  passed is empty or not.

- In rotate90CCW and rotate90CW there is a check in the 
  respective buffer::rotate if the buffer data is empty 
  before executing the functions. Still after calling
  the respective buffer::rotate functions, even if the images
  are empty,it is called the allocateAux function, which
  doesn't check the empty condition. 
  allocateAux will calculate erroneus values.
  For that I decided to put a lamba functions in the bindings
  that returns an error message if the input image is empty,
  otherwise calls the C++ functions.
  An implementation of the error can be found in tests/rotates_test.cpp

- In getDiagonalSize it isn't check if the image is empty,
  the function tries to calculate the result even if all
  the parameters are negative and does sqrt((-1*-1) + (-1*-1)),
  so it returns sqrt(2) = 1.4.
  For that I decided to put in the binding a lambda function that
  checks if the image is empty befor calling getDiagonalSize.
  An implementation of the error can be found in tests/getDiagonalSize_test.cpp

- In isSimilarType checks if the input image is NULL, but not if
  the twos are valid. What can happen is that if I have a empty image and
  a image that reads a existing file, if I copy the values width, height
  frames and channels from full to empty and do isSimilarType, it returns 
  true. For that I decided to put in the bindings a check before calling
  the functions.
